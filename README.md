# Client Management System

Client Management System (CMS) is a data capture web application for Quantum Leap Corporation that aims to simplify the process of onboarding vendors and subcontractors, ensuring that all necessary forms are collected and retained for record-keeping. CMS also allows for approval workflow processing and the ability to visualize which stage of a workflow a vendor is at the moment.
